## Nevinha Code

Nevinha Code will be set of tools to help developers to expose some code on the browser. It's a work in progress, so we have a lot of stuff to do, feel free to contribute in the following points:

- Use some AST (Abstract syntax tree - Maybe @babel/parse) instead of parsing the lines by hand
- Integrate `mdx` loader. Maybe we can take a read at [mdx API](https://mdxjs.com/advanced/api)
- Remove `any` types and type it properly
- Add more languages support, maybe we can re-use the languages from [react-syntax-highlighter](https://github.com/react-syntax-highlighter/react-syntax-highlighter)
- Fix (!) Missing global variable name warning on the rollup config
